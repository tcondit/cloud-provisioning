# Terraform - Azure ACS

Based on example from [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/container_service.html).

Creates a setup based upon the "Docker for Azure" configuration.

ACS stands Azure Container Services, and just another name for Azure for Docker.

A better way to understand how the setup works, is look at [ACS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine).
